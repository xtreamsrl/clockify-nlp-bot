# Contributing to Clockify NLP Bot
Anyone can contribute to the Clockify NLP Bot project and we welcome your contributions.

There are multiple ways to contribute: report bugs, improve the docs, and contribute code, but you must
follow these prerequisites:

- [Raising issues](#raising-issues)
- [Submitting Pull Requests](#submitting-pull-requests)

## Raising issues

Please raise any bug reports or enhancement requests on the GitHub issue tracker. Be sure to search 
the list to see if your issue has already been raised.

A good bug report is one that make it easy for us to understand what you were trying to do and what went wrong. 
Provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.

A good enhancement request comes with an explanation of what you are trying to do and how that enhancement 
would help you.

### Discussion

In addition, we provide a [clockify bot](https://join.slack.com/t/xtreamhacktoberfest/shared_invite/zt-xepmx4tg-gNqv3VWmMr563A2JWKfAzA) 
Slack team channel for conversations.

## Submitting Pull Requests

There are multiple ways to contribute: report bugs, improve the docs, and contribute code, 
but you must follow these prerequisites and guidelines:

- [Let us know you are working on it](#let-us-know-you-are-working-on-it)

- Embrace feedbacks and be ready to make changes to your contributions

- Write tests

- Unless it is a minor change:

  - It is best to discuss pull requests on an issue before doing work

  - We expect the pull request to start with a draft pull request

    - The pull request should be as small as possible and focus on a single unit of change. 
      This ensures that we are collaborating together as soon as possible.

    - We will discuss with you how to iterate once you have submitted the initial draft pull request.

### Let us know you are working on it

If there is already a GitHub issue for the task you are working on, leave a comment to let people know that you are 
working on it. If there isn't already an issue and it is a non-trivial task, it's a good idea to create one (and note 
that you're working on it). This prevents contributors from duplicating effort.
