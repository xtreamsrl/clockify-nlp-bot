        <value>Hi, welcome! I am a natural language processing powered bot 🤖 born to help folks report their time on Clockify efficiently and naturally.{0} I started as an internal tool for [xtream](https://xtreamers.io?utm_source={1}utm_medium=bot&amp;utm_campaign=clockify_bot&amp;utm_content=welcome_message) and then I was rolled out to everyone. Who am I for? {0}- people who tend to fill entries on Clockify manually, and get bored doing so{0}- managers who want to improve data quality on time reports, turning them into actionable insights{0}- people who tend to do this due diligence while on the subway, brushing their teeth, or while on the 🚽 (no shame in that)</value>
    </data>
    <data name="HelpDescription" xml:space="preserve">
        <value>How do I work? As of now I'm pretty simple, and I'll do for you 3 things:{0}- I'll remind you to fill your entries, every day from 5.30pm onwards. I'll stop when I see enough hours in there (6+) or when you tell me to (just say `stop`){0}- at any time you like, you can tell me some work you did. I'll gladly handle something like "add 2 hours for presales", or similar. You can tell me how much time as you prefer (6h, 10 minutes, half day, ...) and you can refer to the project quite freely, I should be smart enough to cover for misspellings, partial names and so on. **Memo:** You can only insert time for the current day.{0}- if you don't remember what time you reported already, just ask me. Something like "my work this week?". Again, feel free to ask for any time range you like, I love a challenge 🙃</value>

    <data name="HelpLanguage" xml:space="preserve">
        <value>Ah, one more thing. I only speak English 💂 for now, but I'm studying other languages 📖😉</value>
    </data>
    <data name="HelpSecurityInfo" xml:space="preserve">
        <value>I was built for people who needed me, nothing more. I don't store any of your data, only your access token for Clockify, which you can revoke or change with a click. And because I value your trust, I store it securely on Microsoft Azure dedicated Key Vault. Don't just take my word for granted, you can check my [source code](https://github.com/xtreamsrl/clockify-nlp-bot) as well, it's open and public! That being said, enjoy chatting with me, and I hope I'll help: for any trouble, open an [issue](https://github.com/xtreamsrl/clockify-nlp-bot/issues) on GitHub, or if you're not of the geeky persuasion just write my creators at oss@xtreamers.io</value>
