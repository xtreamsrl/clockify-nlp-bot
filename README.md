# Clockify NLP Bot

**Clockify NLP Bot** is a [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com) bot developed to act as a timesheet assistant for the busy and the lazy among us.
It reminds proactively people to fill in their time when EOD approaches, and it accepts natural language for creating time entries directly from chat.

It's easy!

## How to use it
It's simple, just open a chat with the bot either on Teams or Telegram.

## Features:

**Proactive reminders**
It will assist you to complete your due diligence. If you have less than 6 hours 
reported on your Clockify (no matter how you put them in) it sends you a reminder.

**Adding time entries with ease**
Add your time flexibly, even indicating projects partially. For example, you can type
`time bot` instead of `time_survey_bot`. If it's not ambiguous, it'll figure it out.

**Smart task request**
Some projects benefit from tasks drill down, some don't. If you never use them on the project, 
it doesn't ask it in the first place.

## Architecture

This bot is hosted by [xtream](https://xtreamers.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=clockify_bot) on Azure Cloud.
This is what it looks like:

## Support

This project was started as an internal tool for our employees, and then we decided to roll it out
to anyone who could benefit from it, with a few tweaks and adjustments. Hence, we'd do our best to work on any issue 
or bug but do consider we're maintaining it on our spare time.

If you'd like to see this project grow in features, richness and support, you can give a ‚≠êÔ∏è to let us know this is helpful. 
You can also buy us a coffee if you like.

## Installing

If you want to host the bot yourself, you'll need to provide for the other components of the architecture on your own.  
The following are minimal instructions for installing and deploying the bot on App Service.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 3.1
```bash
# determine dotnet version
dotnet --version
```

### To run this bot

Make sure to provide required configuration values. The app currently needs a value for these properties:

```json
{
  "LuisAppId": "",
  "LuisAPIKey": "",
  "LuisAPIHostName": "",
  "ProactiveBotApiKey": "",
  "KeyVaultName": "",
  "MicrosoftAppId": "",
  "MicrosoftAppPassword": ""
}
```
Description: 
* LuisAppID: AppId for the app you created within luis.ai
* LuisAPIKey: API Key you set for your LUIS service under portal.azure.com
* LuisAPIHostName: Hostname from portal.azure.com without https://!
* ProactiveBotApiKey: The API Key you need to trigger https://<yourbot>:3978/api/timesheet/remind (pass the API-Key as header info "ProactiveBotApiKey")
* MicrosoftAppId: The AppId of your WebApplication you get from portal.azure.com
* MicrosoftAppPassword: The password for your application. You also get this from portal.azure.com
* KeyVaultName: the name of your Vault storage for storing the tokens

Important: if you test the bot locally, you should use a reduced set of settings: 

```json
{
  "LuisAppId": "",
  "LuisAPIKey": "",
  "LuisAPIHostName": "",
  "ProactiveBotApiKey": ""
}
```
You still need the LUIS service to be active.

### LUIS
For proper operation, you must provide a LUIS model. This can be done at luis.ai

#### Intents
You must create different intents. The intents below are the ones that i've figured out to be the minimum. 
Add also @datetimeV2 as a feature.

![images/img2.jpg](images/img2.jpg)
![images/img3.jpg](images/img3.jpg)

#### Entities
You need also at least one additional entity called "WorkedEntity". This stores the project you have worked on.

### Auto reminder

The auto reminder is triggered by an endpoint. You have to call [GET] http://localhost:3978/api/timesheet/remind and pass ProactiveBotApiKey within the header and pass as value the "ProactiveBotApiKey" value. 

### Clockify
The first time you contact the bot, he will ask you for your clockify API-Key and stores it within the KeyVault. 

### Run

Then run the bot. For example, from a terminal:

```bash
# run the bot
dotnet run
```

### Integration testing setup

- Create a Clockify account and generate an API key
- Create a `test.runsettings` file with the following env variables

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RunSettings>
    <RunConfiguration>
        <EnvironmentVariables>
            <CLOCKIFY_API_KEY><!--API-KEY--></CLOCKIFY_API_KEY>
            <CLOCKIFY_WS_ID><!--ACTIVE-WORKSPACE-ID--></CLOCKIFY_WS_ID>
        </EnvironmentVariables>
    </RunConfiguration>
</RunSettings>
```
- Configure the Test Runner to use the custom settings

### Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

[Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.9.0 or greater from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

#### Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot
- Enter a Bot URL of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`
